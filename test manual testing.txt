Difference between Usecase and testscenario , testcase?
use case is a detailed description of how system intercats with the external
entity as users to accomplish a goal

it focus on features and functionality from user prespective

it is used to understand the user interactions and  system behaviours

test case is a set of condition under which a tester will determine if a system behaves as intended
it focus on validaing specific aspects of the system for funationality, performance, security etc,
and correctness of the software
 it is used to test the system meets the requirements specified and behaves correctly

test scenario is a high level description of test  which foucs on broder aspects
of system's behaveoir covering mulitple funcationalitiea and interactions
it is more detailed than test cases but less detsiled than individual
test cases 
it is created often during the test planning to define the scope
of the testing


Deifference betwwen severity priority?

Severity and Priority:

Severity:

Definition: Severity refers to the impact or seriousness of a defect on 
the system's functionality.

Example: Suppose there's a defect in an e-commerce website where users 
are unable to complete the checkout process. This defect has high severity 
because it directly affects the core functionality of the system, preventing
 users from making purchases.

Priority:
Definition: Priority relates to the order in which defects need to be 
addressed, considering factors like business impact and urgency.

Example: In the e-commerce website scenario, if there's also a defect 
where the product images are not displaying correctly, it might have a 
lower severity compared to the checkout issue. However, if the upcoming
 holiday season is approaching, fixing the image display issue might have 
a higher priority to ensure a positive user experience during a peak period.

Summary:

Severity: How serious is the impact of the defect on the system?
Priority: In what order should the defects be addressed based on business 
impact and urgency?
Both severity and priority help teams in managing and addressing defects 
effectively, allowing them to prioritize their efforts and resources

Sure, let's consider examples for both high and low severity and priority:

High Severity and High Priority:

Example: A critical security vulnerability is discovered in an online 
banking application, exposing users' sensitive information. This has a 
high severity because it poses a significant risk to user data. It also 
has high priority because addressing security issues promptly is crucial 
to prevent potential harm to users and maintain the integrity of the system.

High Severity and Low Priority:
Example: A cosmetic issue is identified on the website's help page where 
the font color slightly mismatches the background color. This has a high 
severity because it affects the visual appearance, but it has a low priority
 as it doesn't impact the core functionality or security of the system. It
 might be addressed in a future release.

Low Severity and High Priority:

Example: A minor glitch is found on the login page of an e-commerce website 
where the "Forgot Password" link is not aligned properly. Although it has 
low severity since it doesn't affect user login functionality, it has high 
priority if there's an upcoming marketing campaign, and the login page 
needs to be visually polished before the campaign launch.

Low Severity and Low Priority:

Example: A typo is discovered in an informational pop-up that appears after
 a user submits a form. The typo does not impact the system's functionality
 or user experience significantly. It has low severity and low priority and
 might be scheduled for correction during routine maintenance.

These examples illustrate how severity and priority can vary independently 
based on the nature of the defect and the context of the overall system and 
project timelines.


Difference between Waterfall model ,V & V model and Agile

The key difference between Agile vs. Waterfall is that Waterfall breaks 
down software development into 
isolated phases that flow into each other, while Agile advocates iterative
 development cycles in which multiple lifecycle phases can run in parallel.

Agile emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative delivery, while 
V-model follows a sequential and phase-based approach with associated 
testing phases. Agile allows for continuous feedback and adaptation, 
while V-model ensures verification and validation at each development phase.

who is scrum master

A Scrum master is a professional who leads a team through a project using 
Agile project management techniques. A Scrum Master facilitates all the 
communication and 
collaboration between leadership and team players to ensure a successful
 outcome.

The scrum master serves to facilitate scrum to the larger team by ensuring 
the scrum framework is followed. He or she is committed to the scrum
 methodology, agile principles, and best practices—but should also remain
 flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow.

what is scrum call

The daily scrum meeting is a "tell-all" session where the scrum team 
shares their accomplishments and future goals. This makes it simple for 
the team to develop an understanding of how quickly and effectively the 
project is moving

what is retrospective meeting

A retrospective meeting, or retro, is a structured session that 
gives teams time to reflect on a completed project. It allows a team 
and individuals to highlight both the successes and failures of a project,
 identify areas that need improvement, and reflect on the project as a 
whole.
